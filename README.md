Planning and Development Process

I began the planning process by creating the user stories. From the user stories I sketched out the wireframes and ERD. I completed the backend prior to starting work on this part of the project. I started the front end by setting up the authorization, setting up sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, change-password. Then I added the ability to index, show, update, create, and destroy purchases. Afterwards I added the user messages and made sure items were available only at the appopriate times. I ended by adding styling and working on the layout.

Unsolved Problems: I would like to add the ability to total all expenses in future iterations.

User Stories:

- As a user I want to be the only person able to access my data and make changes, as I want to keep the infomation private

- As a user I want to be able to have my own profile and be able to sign in / out.

- As a user I wan to be able to update and delete my data so that i can keep my records up to date.

- As a user I want to be able to see all my purchases for with a push of a button upon log-in

- As a user I want the form to reset after each action for security purposes.

- As a user I want adequate feed back from the application so that I know when an action is successfull or failure.
